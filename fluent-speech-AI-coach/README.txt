In order to run the code I used pycharm to create a virtual environment with python. All the libraries needed are inside the requirements.txt file. The audios generated are saved in the same folder in which the app.py is placed.

The LearningBot.ipynb is an older version of the app.py, it works but it is not as updated as the streamlit version, however I share it to highlight the progression.
